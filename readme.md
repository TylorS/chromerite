# Browserite

Managing remote browsers and communicating with them reliably is hard. Browserite is built from the ground up to 
enable the most reliable browser infrastructure possible, with the ability to spin up a new browser instance and
get back to as close to the same state as possible (TODO: Link to some docs on how replays work, and their pitfalls) 
and allowing your scripts to continue from where you left off.

For now I only intend to support Chrome to keep things simple and make it easier to optimize different parts of the system, as well 
as support the ecosystem of Chromium forks around the web!
